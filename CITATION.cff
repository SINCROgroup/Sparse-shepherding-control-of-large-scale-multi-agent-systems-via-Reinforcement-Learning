abstract: >-
  We propose a reinforcement learning framework for sparse
  indirect control of large-scale multi-agent systems, where
  few controlled agents shape the collective behavior of
  many uncontrolled agents. The approach addresses this
  multi-scale challenge by coupling ODEs (modeling
  controlled agents) with a PDE (describing the uncontrolled
  population density), capturing how microscopic control
  achieves macroscopic objectives. Our method combines
  model-free reinforcement learning with adaptive gain
  compensation to overcome sparse actuation limitations.
  Numerical validation demonstrates effective density
  control, with the system achieving target distributions
  while maintaining robustness to disturbances and
  measurement noise, confirming that learning-based sparse
  control can replace computationally expensive online
  optimization.
